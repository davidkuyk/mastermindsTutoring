## Background

Masterminds Tutoring was my local tutoring company in Birmingham, AL for 5 years. I ran all aspects of the company including the website. My primary focus in all of my projects is simplicity. I don't want my sites to waste people's time. I want them to be able to get the info they need as quickly and easily as possible. So, I divided the site into 5 simple pages (besides the home page): testimonials, tutoring info, tutors, contact, and payments. The Schedule Now button, which leads to our scheduling form, is featured prominently at the top of every page.

The tutors page features a grid of cards featuring each tutor, including their picture, background, and hourly rate. There are select boxes at the top of the page that allow the user to filter tutors based on their academic subject, desired meeting place, desired price range, desired tutor gender, their zip code, or a combination of these parameters.

The schedule page features a form that populates different classes, meeting places, and zip codes based on the tutor selected. On submission, the form would send an email to the client with the details of the session they requested, and it would send an email to me so I could check with the tutor to make sure that would work for them before we put it on their calendar.

## Future Feature Ideas

- I shut down the business at the end of 2020 to focus exclusively on my programming career, so there will be no future features. :)
