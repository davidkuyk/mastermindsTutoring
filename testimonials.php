			<p>"You all have the easiest system and make this so convenient. Sick I didn't know about it for my other kids. This just takes the heat off of everyone to have people that they click with.

			<p>"My daughter was struggling with AP Chemistry. She had missed a good bit of school because of an accident and was struggling. After just a couple of sessions at Masterminds Tutoring she regained confidence, homework started getting done more thoroughly, classtime was more valuable and her other classes improved (and mood) because she wasn't spending so much time struggling thru Chem lessons. This has been very valuable to us - The website is easy to navigate and schedule. You can choose your tutor, the time that is convenient for you to meet, and even a meeting location near your home. After every visit you get a report of what the tutor covered, and how/if you child was prepared for the session. Money and time well spent!"</p>
